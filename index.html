        <p>I respect your decision to quit the job.
          I just want to tell you that...</p>
            
        <p>It's been a great journey working with you. It started with a mentor mentee relationship, but I feel I have found a close friend in you.</p>

        <p>You were, Infact you are my go to person and you were available for me whenever I needed you. You've backed me like no one else did. You have always helped me and guided me through every doubt and problem I asked you. Hence I admire you and I feel very lucky to have you in my life.</p>  

        <p>From the day I met you till now, I have enjoyed each and every moment with you. The moments which I'll never forget are the Maggie, the charger, the parties, bitching jose😂, your birthday, the eartips you gave me, bp😆, and many more....</p>

        <p>I know that people come and go in life, but don't want you to go, I want you to stay, stay in touch, because I don't want to lose you. I have already experienced losing close friendships, and I don't want to lose another one. I know ki tula vattat asel ki ha kay pan badbadtoy 😂, but it is what it is.</p>

        <p>With teary eyes and a heavy heart, but a smile on my face, Goodbye to our time together here. I wish you all the very best for your future.</p>

        <p>Take care, will miss you a lot.💓</p>
        <p>Aani ha, invitation dyaila visru nakos 😅.</p>
